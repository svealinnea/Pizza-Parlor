## Specs
Test | Input | Output | 

It should correctly return the type of Pizza chosen with toppings and size. | meat = pepperoni, cheese = mozzarella, topping = olives, size = large | pepperoni, mozzarella, olives, large |
It should correctly return the price of Pizza based on the toppings and size | Pepperoni, Large, Olives | $21.50



## Known Bugs
The only bug I see is that the price does not seem to reflect the options and only spits out $23.
